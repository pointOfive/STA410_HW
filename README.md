# UofT STA410 (Statistical Computation) Programming Problems

UofT students may access this the collection of programming problems with the [UofT JupyterHub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca) via

> https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/pointOfive/STA140_HW0&branch=master

- Some notes to faciltate getting started in this environment are available on the UofT JupyterHub [support page](https://act.utoronto.ca/jupyterhub-support/).
- An alternative computing resource that would work without UofT authentication is [google colab](colab.research.google.com).
