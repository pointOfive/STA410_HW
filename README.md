# UofT STA410/2102 Statistical Computation

UofT students may access STA410 programming homework assignment coding problems with the [UofT JupyterHub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca)
or [google colab](http://colab.research.google.com) via

- Some notes to faciltate getting started in this environment are available on the UofT JupyterHub [support page](https://act.utoronto.ca/jupyterhub-support/).
- If for some reason JupyterHub is not loading the repository, you can delete and reload repositories (after downloading and saving what you need).
  > From JupyterHub, open a new terminal with `New` > `Terminal` and then use `yes y | rm -r <path to directory to delete>` to a delete the repository directory.

0. [Programming Homework Assignment 0](https://github.com/pointOfive/sta410hw0#uoft-sta4102102-statistical-computation) introduces Python through the following foundational computational and statistical computation problems:

1. Bit string representation of integer value numbers
2. Pseudorandom integer generation with modulus
3. Floating-point error accumulation reduction
4. High precision single pass variance calculations
